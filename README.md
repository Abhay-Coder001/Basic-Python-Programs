# Python-Basic-Program-Challenge-Series
In this series i cover each topics with various easy examples for every concept i create seprate file 

##**for if else**

I created ' if_else.py ' 
In this we see "If statement allow your program to make decision and change the route that is taken through
the program
In this i also cover basic concept of #Comparison_Operators
 >Operator   Description
 > ==         Equal to
 >!=         Not equal to
 > " >, <,"      Greater than, Less then
 > >=,<=      Greater than equals to, Less then equals to
  
 **Logical_Operators**
 Operator            Description
   and          Both conditions must be met
   or          Either conditions must be met

##**for strings** 

I created 'Strings.py'
String is the technical name for text. To define a block of code as a string, you need to
include it in either double quotes (") or single quotes ('). It doesn’t matter which you use so
long as you are consistent.
There are some characters you need to be particularly careful with when inputting them
into strings. These include:
" ' \
That is because these symbols have special meanings in Python and it can get confusing if
you use them in a string.

Multiple-Line Strings
If you want to input a string across multiple lines you can either use the line break (\n) or
you can enclose the entire thing in triple quotes. This will preserve the formatting of the
text.
  address = """123
  Oldtown
  ABI 43BF"""
  print(address)
 
 
###I also introduce some functions

`len(word)`
Fnds the length of the variable called word.

`word.upper()` 
Changes the string into upper case

`print(word.capitalize())`
Displays the variable so only the first word
has a capital letter at the beginning and
everything else is in lower case.

`word.title()'
Changes a phrase so that every word
has a capital letter at the beginning
with the rest of the letters in the
word in lower case (i.e.Title Case).

`text = “ This is some text. ”
print(text.strip(“ ”))`
Removes extra characters (in this case spaces) from the start and end of a string.

`print (“Hello world”[7:10])`
Each letter is assigned an index number to
identify its position in the phrase, including
the space. Python starts counting from 0, not
1.
Therefore, in this example, it would display
the value of positions 7, 8 and 9 ,which is
“orl”.
name = firstname+surname


# for math
I created math.py
## for loop
I created loops.py
